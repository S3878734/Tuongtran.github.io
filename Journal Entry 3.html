        <h1>Journal Entry 3</h1>
        <a href="index.html">Back to home page</a>
        <p>It has been one week and once again I will provide you with another journal entry. Last week, I attended a lecture on a topic that I find interesting as well as useful for RMIT’s student body. It is called Active & Independent Learning. In the lecture, we get to know about Active and Independent learning, what kind of skills are required, how do we acquire those skills and the importance of having them in your university life. But those skills are not what spiked my interest for those are only part of it. Another point that made me feel interested in the class was what comes after the class when we get to know how to make our website and the tool/app that will support us.</p> 
 
            <p>When the lecture started, we didn’t immediately begin the new lecture but to cover some ground of the previous which we haven’t finished yet. For the first few minutes, I was the only participant because the other two were running late, but the new learning experience makes it even more exciting. When today's topic begins, we dive into the depth of what is Active and Independent learning, what are the skills required, and because technology careers are fast-changing, the importance of these skills is shown to us as well. After that, we start to work on how to obtain those skills such as making learning become a habit, learn from your failures, and how to apply those skills in your daily life.</p>

            <p>During the entire lecture, everything went smoothly and fast. today's topic is kind of short. Our lecture provides us with knowledge and examples, at the same time we contribute to the lesson by sharing our experience of the topic. After the lesson ended, we got to take a peek at how to make our website, and the app that will help us create it is called visual studio. It let us start to program our very own website with clear instructions step by step provided by our teacher. For us, as technology students, this will be an exciting challenge to experience.</p>

            <p>In conclusion, Active and Independent learning is an important skill to have in university. I recommend any new student to start acquiring this skill by participating in class more frequently, seek help when needed and make studying an everyday habit (Open Polytechnic, Chloe Burroughs,2017). As for me, I will work on what I recommended as well as experiencing the new app and familiarize myself with it. That way when the time comes that I have to make a website for my third assignment, I can start working immediately and be confident to have a great score.</p>
