        <h1>Journal Entry 2</h1>
        <a href="index.html">Back to home page</a>
        <p>It has been one week since the first journal entry. In that time, I have encountered some very curious points about doing research. Now in the last course, our student body has committed a lot of research for our assignment, but I have never dive deep into knowing what research is and the alternative ways to perform it correctly. Before joining the two previous lectures with Mr.Duy I expect it would just be a review of what is doing research then we will have a discussion about one of our assignments but instead, we were introduced to what is really doing research, ethics in research, and multiple ways to perform it correctly.</p>
 
            <p>In the first lecture, at first, we didn’t start the lectures right away as I expected it to. Instead, there was a training session that my classmate participated in to know about the rules when staying in the classroom so we are allowed entrance to any technologies and science classroom. After that, the lecture starts and we begin to look into what is really doing research, the meaning of being ethical when researching for information, and the importance of it when writing a report or a journal. Interestingly, there are also various ways to research such as quantitative or qualitative approaches.</p>
  
            <p>In the second lecture, we continue where we left off and look into data analysis and the tools to support you in it. One of the tools that have really spiked my interest is python. Despite the fact that there are different types of tools for descriptive data, python catches the most of my interest because of my goal to become a software engineer. With python, one can descript the data and familiarize yourself with code writing at the same time. Lastly, we started to look into various ways of referencing and which one that we as RMIT students allowed to use.</p>
  
            <p>After the week, I would recommend new students to look into what is really doing research because it will be very useful for the time to come studying at RMIT University. For myself, I’m sure that I won't forget this lesson anytime soon and will put it to good use in the future. Especially python, that way I can descript data for my assignments and familiarize myself with the tools at the same time. That way I can reach my goal as a software engineer a lot sooner.</p>
