        <p>In the past week, a noticeable change occurred because of the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic and the access to campus has been forbidden except for a few specific classes and the rest have to take online classes at home. And so, in this week lectures, a guest named Dr.Minh Ngoc Dinh has arrived in our topic 9 class to teach us about the concept of blockchain, its component, how it is applied in our life and why do we have to discuss it now in our Introduction to Science and Technology course.</p>
            <p>At the start of the class, I was introduced to Dr.Minh, an RMIT staff member, so that he can show us what blockchain is. Firstly, we get to know about the conception of blockchain, how it works as a database that has its data linked together then go through step by step provided by DR.Minh to know why we have to walk through this subject in this course, its component, and application of blockchain and the usage of cryptographic in it. In our next step, we discovered that we have to know about blockchain this early because it is an emerging technology and has a lot of predictions about its potentials with most of them saying that blockchain will play a significant role in the future of technology. Following it were the 3 primary components that blockchain has, The understanding of blockchain itself, the importance of the peer-to-peer work role, and finally the understanding of the consensus mechanism (Thijs Maas,2017). Lastly, we learn about the usage of blockchain in our technology work life, many companies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and many more have applied it as a database and transaction point.</p>
            <p>As the lecture progressed, everything went smoothly. The only flaw that I find is the speed of our guest's speech because of how fast he talks. I have to ask him to slow down or we might not achieve any knowledge in this class otherwise.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, Blockchain might be playing an important role in the near future. So Iâ€™d recommend any new students, especially technology students to look it up in their free time. It will help you understand how it works and familiarize yourself with the P2P workstyle because you will have a lot of group work here in RMIT.</p>
