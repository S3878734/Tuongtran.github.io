        <p>Hello World!</p>
        <p>Journal Entry 1</p>
        <p>Today will mark the day that I become an RMIT university student for nearly two months, but despite that time, I still have yet to discover all of RMIT facilities, there are still places I haven’t been to and places I know existed but don’t know how it works or functions. One of those places is the library. In the first weeks of my new science and technology course, I was finally getting a chance to know more about the university’s library in one of my lectures. Before joining the lecture, I didn’t expect much because I thought that it wouldn’t be much different from my high school one but I couldn’t be more wrong.
       	
            <p>My interest piqued right away when the class started for the university library. It was so much different than my high school one. To my surprise, instead of one book each week, I get to rent a maximum of 25 books for a whole month and the payment for a late return is only five thousand Vietnam currency. But that is not what makes me interested in the university library, the reason it caught my attention is because of the digital library the school provides. With what seems like an endless supply of works, journals and news for research purposes, easy access even at home makes it so much easier to research information for a school assignment.</p>
             
            <p>Later, near the end of the lecture, we got a tour around the library by the lecturer to help us know more about how it functions. There I further learned that the library not only provides information but it can also boost motivation for students in a psychological way thanks to the decoration inside the library. Additionally, there are also some machines such as printers or computer stations inside to provide help to the student body anytime they need. With helpful librarians always ready for support makes the library one of the perfect places for self-study or study as a group.</p>
             
            <p>After the lecture and getting to know the library, I would recommend any new students to spend some of their spare time visiting the library, it would surely support you in your life as a university student. As for myself, I will make sure to use the library more for self-study, research purposes in the near future so that my journey as a university student will be an easier one.
