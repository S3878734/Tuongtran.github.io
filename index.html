        <p>Hello World!</p>
        <p style="color:white"> Journal Entry 1</p>
        <p>Today will mark the day that I become an RMIT university student for nearly two months, but despite that time, I still have yet to discover all of RMIT facilities, there are still places I haven’t been to and places I know existed but don’t know how it works or functions. One of those places is the library. In the first weeks of my new science and technology course, I was finally getting a chance to know more about the university’s library in one of my lectures. Before joining the lecture, I didn’t expect much because I thought that it wouldn’t be much different from my high school one but I couldn’t be more wrong.
       	
            <p>My interest piqued right away when the class started for the university library. It was so much different than my high school one. To my surprise, instead of one book each week, I get to rent a maximum of 25 books for a whole month and the payment for a late return is only five thousand Vietnam currency. But that is not what makes me interested in the university library, the reason it caught my attention is because of the digital library the school provides. With what seems like an endless supply of works, journals and news for research purposes, easy access even at home makes it so much easier to research information for a school assignment.</p>
             
            <p>Later, near the end of the lecture, we got a tour around the library by the lecturer to help us know more about how it functions. There I further learned that the library not only provides information but it can also boost motivation for students in a psychological way thanks to the decoration inside the library. Additionally, there are also some machines such as printers or computer stations inside to provide help to the student body anytime they need. With helpful librarians always ready for support makes the library one of the perfect places for self-study or study as a group.</p>
             
            <p>After the lecture and getting to know the library, I would recommend any new students to spend some of their spare time visiting the library, it would surely support you in your life as a university student. As for myself, I will make sure to use the library more for self-study, research purposes in the near future so that my journey as a university student will be an easier one.</p>

        <p>Journal Entry 2</p>
        <p>It has been one week since the first journal entry. In that time, I have encountered some very curious points about doing research. Now in the last course, our student body has committed a lot of research for our assignment, but I have never dive deep into knowing what research is and the alternative ways to perform it correctly. Before joining the two previous lectures with Mr.Duy I expect it would just be a review of what is doing research then we will have a discussion about one of our assignments but instead, we were introduced to what is really doing research, ethics in research, and multiple ways to perform it correctly.</p>
 
            <p>In the first lecture, at first, we didn’t start the lectures right away as I expected it to. Instead, there was a training session that my classmate participated in to know about the rules when staying in the classroom so we are allowed entrance to any technologies and science classroom. After that, the lecture starts and we begin to look into what is really doing research, the meaning of being ethical when researching for information, and the importance of it when writing a report or a journal. Interestingly, there are also various ways to research such as quantitative or qualitative approaches.</p>
  
            <p>In the second lecture, we continue where we left off and look into data analysis and the tools to support you in it. One of the tools that have really spiked my interest is python. Despite the fact that there are different types of tools for descriptive data, python catches the most of my interest because of my goal to become a software engineer. With python, one can descript the data and familiarize yourself with code writing at the same time. Lastly, we started to look into various ways of referencing and which one that we as RMIT students allowed to use.</p>
  
            <p>After the week, I would recommend new students to look into what is really doing research because it will be very useful for the time to come studying at RMIT University. For myself, I’m sure that I won't forget this lesson anytime soon and will put it to good use in the future. Especially python, that way I can descript data for my assignments and familiarize myself with the tools at the same time. That way I can reach my goal as a software engineer a lot sooner.</p>

        <p>Journal Entry 3</p>
        <p>It has been one week and once again I will provide you with another journal entry. Last week, I attended a lecture on a topic that I find interesting as well as useful for RMIT’s student body. It is called Active & Independent Learning. In the lecture, we get to know about Active and Independent learning, what kind of skills are required, how do we acquire those skills and the importance of having them in your university life. But those skills are not what spiked my interest for those are only part of it. Another point that made me feel interested in the class was what comes after the class when we get to know how to make our website and the tool/app that will support us.</p> 
 
            <p>When the lecture started, we didn’t immediately begin the new lecture but to cover some ground of the previous which we haven’t finished yet. For the first few minutes, I was the only participant because the other two were running late, but the new learning experience makes it even more exciting. When today's topic begins, we dive into the depth of what is Active and Independent learning, what are the skills required, and because technology careers are fast-changing, the importance of these skills is shown to us as well. After that, we start to work on how to obtain those skills such as making learning become a habit, learn from your failures, and how to apply those skills in your daily life.</p>

            <p>During the entire lecture, everything went smoothly and fast. today's topic is kind of short. Our lecture provides us with knowledge and examples, at the same time we contribute to the lesson by sharing our experience of the topic. After the lesson ended, we got to take a peek at how to make our website, and the app that will help us create it is called visual studio. It let us start to program our very own website with clear instructions step by step provided by our teacher. For us, as technology students, this will be an exciting challenge to experience.</p>

            <p>In conclusion, Active and Independent learning is an important skill to have in university. I recommend any new student to start acquiring this skill by participating in class more frequently, seek help when needed and make studying an everyday habit (Open Polytechnic, Chloe Burroughs,2017). As for me, I will work on what I recommended as well as experiencing the new app and familiarize myself with it. That way when the time comes that I have to make a website for my third assignment, I can start working immediately and be confident to have a great score.</p>

        <p>Journal Entry 4</p>
        <p>In the past week, a noticeable change occurred because of the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic and the access to campus has been forbidden except for a few specific classes and the rest have to take online classes at home. And so, in this week lectures, a guest named Dr.Minh Ngoc Dinh has arrived in our topic 9 class to teach us about the concept of blockchain, its component, how it is applied in our life and why do we have to discuss it now in our Introduction to Science and Technology course.</p>
            <p>At the start of the class, I was introduced to Dr.Minh, an RMIT staff member, so that he can show us what blockchain is. Firstly, we get to know about the conception of blockchain, how it works as a database that has its data linked together then go through step by step provided by DR.Minh to know why we have to walk through this subject in this course, its component, and application of blockchain and the usage of cryptographic in it. In our next step, we discovered that we have to know about blockchain this early because it is an emerging technology and has a lot of predictions about its potentials with most of them saying that blockchain will play a significant role in the future of technology. Following it were the 3 primary components that blockchain has, The understanding of blockchain itself, the importance of the peer-to-peer work role, and finally the understanding of the consensus mechanism (Thijs Maas,2017). Lastly, we learn about the usage of blockchain in our technology work life, many companies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and many more have applied it as a database and transaction point.</p>
            <p>As the lecture progressed, everything went smoothly. The only flaw that I find is the speed of our guest's speech because of how fast he talks. I have to ask him to slow down or we might not achieve any knowledge in this class otherwise.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, Blockchain might be playing an important role in the near future. So I’d recommend any new students, especially technology students to look it up in their free time. It will help you understand how it works and familiarize yourself with the P2P workstyle because you will have a lot of group work here in RMIT.</p>

        <p>Action plans</p>
        <p>After finishing the Introduction to Science and Technology course, I have learned and gain many new things to aid me on my journey as an RMIT student such as the advantages that come with the library, the benefits of knowing the right ways to do research, be an active learner, learning about cryptography, etc. Furthermore, this course has introduced me to where and how to use various facilities provided by the university like the library, lab rooms, medical center, and even our very own sports and recreation building dedicated to the student body’s health and exercise. These facilities are shown online in order for the student body to utilize the resources appropriately to ensure their best result.</p>
            <p>But only knowing using the available resources is still not enough. Ever since entering the university, I know that a different approach in my way of learning is required and thus I started to mold myself to become an active and independent learner if I want to get my desired result. In addition to reviewing previous materials, I started to familiarize myself to interact more during lecture, sharing my experience, and looking up the available pre-class materials to make questions to ask in the lecture. But that will still only take me halfway through my student life. To be a good student, I have to know how to manage my timetable appropriately so as to not waste too much of my time. I can not deny that playing games is what I did most in my free time when I was growing up. Luckily it is not so bad to labor it addicted but if I don’t play at least one or two games a day, I will feel conflicted and agitated and can not focus on the job at hand. And so, I have decided to set three-thirty minutes breaks in my free time so that after a period of self-study, I can allow my brain to relax before resuming on school-related project and if I get stuck, I can reschedule my timetable and set up a meeting on RMIT connect to have a meeting with SAS for support.</p>
